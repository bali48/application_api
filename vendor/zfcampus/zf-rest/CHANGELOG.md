### Fixed

- [#97](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-rest/pull/97) fixes `Location` header
  generation in the `RestController::create()` method to only use the `href`
  property of the relational link; previously, if you'd defined additional
  properties, these were also incorrectly serialized in the generated link.
